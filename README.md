An RPG Discord bot created in DSharp library in C# language  
![Screen of bot in Discord](/Screens/ScreenOne.png)

## About Bot
This bot has been created as a side project for fun. It uses DSharp version 4.2.0 so it does not provieds slash commands yet. It provides simple commands as well as an RPG system with customisable database written using EF Core.  
Every user can add new items, mobs and lore to create his own unique RPG world.

## Bugs
This bot is still under development so it may contain bugs, which will be fixed in the future if found. Combat and leveling system may be still unbalanced but is balanced whenever
possible

## Future Development
There are few things planned to be added in the future
- Updating to the newest DSharp library and changing commands to slash commands
- Talking with bot via Chat GPT - Done
- Add descriptions of quests/fights generated by AI
- Writing Web UI to improve admin experience and make database managment easier (now commands are used to maintain database)
- Adding music player 
- Adding new features to the RPG system
- Overall user experience improvements

Of course development and maintanance of existing features will always take place
